3. 3. An ocean wave with a period T = 27 s is traveling in a water depth of d = 100 m. At this depth neither the deep-water nor the shallow-water approximations are valid. Recall that this is the full dispersion relation for surface gravity wave in any water depth d. 
 (2/T)2 = (g2/L) tanh(2d/L) 
Use the full dispersion relation to estimate the wavelength L.
Notice that you can’t solve this equation for wavelength L directly. Instead you will solve the equation by guessing L and checking to see if both sides of the equation are equal. 
You can use the following steps to estimate L. (Note that all parts of the above equation are known except L.) 
1. Start with a guess of wavelength L. You might, for example, try the deep-water wavelength with period T = 27 s. 
2. Calculate the quantity: A = (2/T)2 - (2g/L) tanh(2d/L) 
Note that A is just the left hand side of the dispersion relation (above in bold) minus the right hand side. With a nearly correct value of L, A will be close to zero. If you found the exact value of L then A would be exactly zero.
3. Try different values of L systematically such that A gets smaller for each value of L. 
4. When A is in the range of about -0.0005 to about +0.0005, your estimate of L will be a reasonable approximation of the exact value of L.  In studies of waves, versions of this trial-and-error procedure are typically used for solving this equation. 
Feel free to use Excel for this. For example, you could enter the equation for A into Excel which would make A easy to calculate. You could also use a programmable calculator.  If you are familiar with a programming language like MATLAB you could also use that.


#Following steps 1 and 2
```{r}
T = 27 #perid in s
g = 9.8 #gravity
d=100 #depth in m

L <- g*(T^2)/(2*pi) #deep water

A <- function (T, g, L, d){
A <- (2*pi/T)^2-(2*pi*g/L)*tanh(2*pi*d/L)
return(A)
}
A (T=27, g=9.8, d=100, L=1137)
```

#Trying small values of L

```{r}

A1 <- A(T=27, g=9.8, d=100, L=1000)
A2 <- A(T=27, g=9.8, d=100, L=800)
A3 <- A(T=27, g=9.8, d=100, L=500)
A4 <- A(T=27, g=9.8, d=100, L=300)


L<-c(600:800)

A_values <- A(T=27, g=9.8, d=100, L=L)

df <-data.frame("Wavelength" <- L,
                  "A"<- A_values)
df
